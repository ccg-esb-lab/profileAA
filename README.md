The following Jupyter Notebooks are coded in Julia and can be found in code/jl-files/

**Figure 1:** Proteome dynamics model.  
Plotting script: Figure1.ipynb

**Figure 5:** ppGpp modulates the profile of interaction in cross-feeding communities.  
Plotting script: Figure5.ipynb

Data analysis was peformed in Python, with scripts that can be found in code/py-files_data/

**Figure 3:** Interaction profiles of E. coli strains with different amino acid auxotrophies.  
Plotting script: Figure3.ipynb

Also, the following data analysis scripts are coded in Matlab and can be found in code/m-files_data/. 

**Figure 4:** Cross-feeding interaction between ΔleuB and ΔtyrA.  
Plotting scripts: Figure4AB.m & Figure4CD.m

**Figure 5:** Amino acid checkerboard experiments.
